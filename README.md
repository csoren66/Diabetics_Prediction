**1.Data analysis:** Here one will get to know about how the data analysis part is done in a data science life cycle.<br/>
**2.Exploratory data analysis:** 
EDA is one of the most important steps in the data science project life cycle and here one will need to know that how to make inferences from the visualizations and data analysis
**3.Model building:** 
Here we will be using ML model.
**4.Saving model:** 
Saving the best model using pickle to make the prediction from real data.
